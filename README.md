This is the webpage of the open-source packages of our paper submitted to
ICRA2016. Our implementation of dense tracking is built on the top of the
open-source and vectorized implementation of [1]. Our package is compatible with
the standard driver of VI-Sensor and ROS version of indigo. OpenCV is needed.
